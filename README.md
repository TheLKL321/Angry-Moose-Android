# Angry Moose
Angry Moose is an Android game where you become a guy who decided to attack a moose in a forest (who may or may not be drunk).

### Installation
As the game is still work in progress, postponed indefinitely, the only way to play it is to clone the repository and build the project yourself using an IDE or other tools (or ask [me](https://github.com/TheLKL321/) nicely).

### About the game
It's turn and text based. The moose begins, and you pick your move. The outcome is random, with some answers having a higher chance of a positive outcome.
